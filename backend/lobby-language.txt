when player connects, they are automatically sent lobby_info:
{"lobbies": [{"players": [], "max_size": 4, "amnt_players": 4}, {"players": [], "max_size": 4, "amnt_players": 2}], "type": "lobby_info"}
eventually, the 'players' list in that json message will be player IDs.
Front end should: display these lobby choices graphically so the user can pick one, along with the choice to make a new lobby

if a client wants to request to join a lobby:
type: 'lobby_request'
id: [whatever id it wants to join]

errors on joining a lobby:
lobby_full
lobby_dne
otherwise, success: lobby_joined
