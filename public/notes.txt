Animate.js: takes care of delay in frames and making rendering look nice in general,
we probably don't have to worry about anything inside of it

Scroller.js: This is the object you instantiate when you want a canvas. Implements
all of the panning and zooming. Also implements what to do on touch start/stop

Tiling.js: Dictates what tiles to be drawn when location to render is being modified

ui.js: Has all of the eventlisteners in it. Also declares the scroller object

gamecore.js: Has the grid + cell classes for now. Declares the game grid,
canvas, and content
